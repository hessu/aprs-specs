APRS BASE91 COMMENT TELEMETRY
2012-01-11 Heikki Hannikainen, OH7LZB

--- 1. Abstract ---

This document specifies a new telemetry transmission format which can
be used to transmit machine-readable telemetry in the comment field
of an APRS position packet.

A new APRS extension was needed for the following reasons:

- Transmitting telemetry in separate, long packets from mobile and
  balloon platforms wastes bandwidth and energy.

- The old Mic-E telemetry format was broken by the introduction of
  new Mic-E Type Codes (http://www.aprs.org/aprs12/mic-e-types.txt),
  as the identifier characters were reused.

- Plain-text human-readable comment telemetry ("12.3V 14C") is very
  hard for an application to automatically parse and graph.

Design emphasis was put on good compression, enhanced resolution and
backward compatibility.


Please read APRS101.PDF chapter 13 ("Telemetry Data") first. This
specification only adds a new format used to transmit telemetry values.
Otherwise the old specification is still valid.

The protocol has been designed in collaboration by Byon Garrabrant, Bob
Bruninga, Lynn W. Deffenbaugh and Heikki Hannikainen during a lengthy
email discussion in March, 2010.

--- 2. Status ---

The extension has been implemented in aprs.fi (within the open-source
Ham::APRS::FAP packet parser), APRSIS32 and the TinyTrak3 platforms.
It should still be considered experimental in nature. It has not been
deployed on many platforms, and all of the platforms are in active
development, so the specification can be enhanced further if necessary.

--- 3. Specification ---

3.1 The new Base91 Comment Telemetry extension MAY appear in the comment
field of any of the three position packet formats ("Normal" uncompressed,
Mic-E, and compressed).

3.2 The Base91 Telemetry extension, if present, MUST appear after the
free-form comment text entered by the end-user, but before any DAO or
Mic-E type codes. The DAO extension MAY appear after the Base91
Telemetry extension. When the Mic-E Type Code is used, it must appear
in the end of the packet.

3.3 Base91 telemetry is delimited at both ends by the '|' (pipe / vertical
bar) character.

3.4 The telemetry sequence counter and telemetry channels are encoded using
the Base91 encoding, as it is presently used in Compressed APRS position
packets, the altitude extension, and the DAO extension. Two bytes are
transmitted for the sequence counter and each of the channels, giving over
13 bits of resolution (values 0 to 8280). Please note that APRS uses a
different definition of Base91 than the internet standard Base91 - see
APRS101.PDF for details.

3.5 While the Base91 encoding provides more resolution and a larger sequence
counter range, the transmitting station may use whatever resolution is
available from the sensors. Values of 0 to 255 are fine for 8-bit
A/D converters - upscaling to 0...8280 is not necessary.

3.6 The telemetry sequence counter MAY wrap from 255 to 0 if memory
constraints require using a 1-byte variable for storing the counter. Please
make sure that it and all of the telemetry values never get values higher
than 8280. For example, the sequence number can be safely incremented with:

   sequence = (sequence + 1) & 0x1FFF;

This will make it wrap to 0 after 8191, which will provide plenty of range.

3.7 The extension MUST contain at least a sequence counter and one channel of
telemetry.

3.8 The extension MAY contain up to 5 channels of "analog values" and one
8-bit channel of "binary values", as in the traditional telemetry format.

3.9 If binary values are transmitted, they MUST appear last in the
extension, after all 5 "analog" channels. They are put into a single
Base91 encoded integer, where the LSB (least significant bit) corresponds
to B1 of the traditional Telemetry specification, the 8th bit corresponds
to B8. Bits 9 to 13 are reserved to future use and will not currently be
treated as additional binary values.

3.10 Examples of valid Base91 telemetry formats:

   |ss11|
   |ss112233|
   |ss1122334455!"|

Where ss is the sequence counter, 11 is the first channel, and so on. The
'!"' in the end would be the binary values. These examples, while useful for
demonstration, would also parse correctly.

   Sequence:  Base91 'ss' decodes to 7544
   Channel 1: Base91 '11' decodes to 1472
   Channel 2: Base91 '22' decodes to 1564
   Channel 3: Base91 '33' decodes to 1656
   Channel 4: Base91 '44' decodes to 1748
   Channel 5: Base91 '55' decodes to 1840
   Binary values:    '!"' decodes to decimal 1, binary values 10000000,
                          B1 is 1, B2 to B8 are 0.

The following minimal telemetry extension has a sequence number of 0,
and Channel 1 value of 0:

3.11 Examples of complete packets containing Base91 telemetry

3.11.1 Mic-E position, 2 channels of Base91 telemetry, !DAO! and Mic-E
Type Code:

N0CALL>APRS,qAR,IGATE:`pZ3l-B]/'"6{}|!9'X$u|!wr8!|3
----------------------position------|tlm---|!DAO!|type

3.11.2 Compressed position, comment text, and 3 channels of Base91
telemetry:

N0CALL>APRS,qAR,IGATE:!/0%3RTh<6>dS_http://aprs.fi/|"p%T'.ag|
----------------------position------comment--------|tlm-----|

3.11.3 Uncompressed position, PHG, comment text, and 4 channels of
telemetry:

N0CALL>APRS,qAR,IGATE:!6304.03NN02739.63E#PHG26303/Siilinjarvi|"p%T'.agff|
----------------------position------------PHG-----/comment----|tlm-------|

3.12 The existing method for transmitting coefficients and channel
definitions are not changed by this specification. They can still be
used in conjuction with Base91 Comment Telemetry. While the format only
supports positive integers, negative and decimal values can be displayed
with the help of periodically transmitted coefficients, as before.

--- 4. Backwards compatibility considerations ---

4.1 Stream switch character |

The APRS specification mentions | as being a forbidden character in APRS
packets, due to it's historical use as the stream switch character in TNCs.
However in practice, it appears to traverse unharmed on the APRS and
APRS-IS networks. It is also used in the Mic-E Type Code for the
Byonics TinyTrack family.

The stream switch character was used to address multiple concurrent
connections over a serial line between a computer and a TNC. It was only
used in CONVers mode (plaintext terminal mode), as opposed to the
machine-readable and binary clean KISS mode.

Digipeaters run in either KISS mode, or otherwise directly operate on the
binary AX.25 frames, and do not process the stream switch character.

Igates using a TNC in TNC2 mode appear to work fine. There is some concern
that it could cause issues if an igate in TNC2 mode would retransmit
packets in 3rd-party format. However, at the time of writing over 400
trackers transmitting Base91 telemetry have been used in the field. No
adverse effects on the network have been reported. '|' usage in the Mic-E
Type Code should have brought up any issues early on.

4.2 DAO ambiguity

A valid-looking !DAO! extension may appear in the middle of a Base91
encoded telemetry extension, since some telemetry sequence could be
accidentally encoded to look the same.

According to the APRS Client Capabilities Chart maintained by Curt, WE7U,
!DAO! decoding is not very widely implemented. It is implemented in
APRSIS32 and aprs.fi, both of which can now decode Base91 comment
telemetry. The strict order specification in 3.2 allows unambiguous
decoding of both extensions.
